# Backend_from_scratch

This repository is a hands-on exploration of backend engineering concepts,
implemented from first principles with minimal abstractions.

The goal is not to learn a framework, but to understand **how backend systems
actually work** — from HTTP and routing to concurrency, scaling, and reliability.

## Philosophy

- Concepts over frameworks
- Explicit over magical
- Systems thinking over CRUD demos
- Production concerns from day one
